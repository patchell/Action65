This is yet another attempt on my part to create an ACTION! cross compiler 
for the 6502.

November 1, 2024.
Working the kinks out of the Grammar (action.gram).  There were a few
places where I overthought things just a bit.  "There is just no way
that is correct!", but I was wrong, it was right, so I had to change it to what 
it was supposed to be.
So, if you thought you would turn this in as your compiler design class
project, well, it won't happen this quarter.  Maybe next quarter. ;)

As of Oct 30, 2024 I am in the process of testing the parser.
The parser in an LL(1) grammar that is implemented with a recursive
decent parseer.  Or, at least, I hope so.  I have expanded the language a little
bit, such as adding a BOOL type, adding an INTERRUPT proceedure type,
and in line assembly with syntax checking.

This is all the easy part.  The hard part is code generation.  I purchased
a new book, that I hope, will give me new insights on how to go about
doing this sort of thing.
